This is our final project for BIO 362!

**Question:**
Are protein expressions different in cancers without known driver mutations?

We were motivated to explore what causes cancer, so we wanted to look at cancers where we don't know what causes it.

**Known Driver Mutations**
We found a list of genes known to have driver mutations of pancreatic cancer using IntOGen. https://www.intogen.org/search?cancer=PAAD. These are included in a tsv file.

Filtering the pancreatic cancer set, we found no samples that didn't have a known driver mutation. So, we decided to look at another cancer set. We used IntOGen again, this time with breast cancer. https://www.intogen.org/search?cancer=BRCA.
